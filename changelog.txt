changes in backend id03.py:
	improved calculation of Delta and Gamma in id03 backend (EH1, EH2, GisaxsDetector)
	added calculation of standard deviations in id03 backend using Poisson statistics (EH1, EH2, GisaxsDetector)
		added in function process_image(), which now returns a 4-tuple (intensity, weights, variances, params)
		if you use another backend you should change the process_image() function in the same way (calculate variances and return them as well)

changes in binoculars-fitaid:
	structure factor calculation
		the non interpolated structure factor now also includes proper error propagation, if the loaded space provides variances. If not, recreate the space with BINoculars. Otherwise 0 is assumed for missing variances.
		the interpolated structure factor overestimates the error (linear instead of Gaussian error propagation used)
		the fitted structure factor does not provide any error propagation
	smaller fixes (parameter names, peak tracker, ...)
	spaces are now stored in memory during operation (speeds up fitaid a lot) and not read/written from/to file all the time
	fitaid now supports PyQt4, PyQt5, PySide and PySide2
	Python 3 support added

changes in binoculars-gui:
	removed subtraction of spaces
	fixed merging of spaces


fixed lots of small errors and typos
fixed peak fitting
fixed trim() (export of spaces in binoculars-gui)
3d plots show a rebinned version of space due to speed reasons
